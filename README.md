# VR project - Mystic Mix

"Mystic Mix is a virtual reality video game set in a small, cozy bar where the player takes on the role of a classic Tarot deck. In this mysterious space, the player works as a mystical barista, receiving requests through a crystal ball. By combining certain magical ingredients, they can create powerful drinks capable of shaping the destiny of the customers. 
Our application belongs to the entertainment sector, offering a relaxing and educational experience about tarot."
